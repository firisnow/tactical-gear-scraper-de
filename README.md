# tactical-gear-scraper-de

This project was created to track the availability of hard-to-get tactical items in German online stores 
to help volunteers in Germany and Ukraine in their job of providing humanitarian aid.

I cannot vouch for this code to be neither clean nor generalizable, it's a quick-and-dirty solution in these dire times. :)
